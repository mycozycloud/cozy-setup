# Cozy Setup

Cozy Cloud aims to be used remotely. We provide here only stuff to deploy
it on a remote server (debian/ubuntu). 
To make a local installation, we recommend you to start a
virtual machine, then run script with this vm as your remote server.

# How to install cozy on your server ?

The installation requires a system up to date with upstart as daemon manager.
You can do it by running following commands on your target server:

    sudo apt-get update  
    sudo apt-get upgrade  
    sudo apt-get install upstart  
    sudo reboot now  

On your local machine clone this repository and install Fabric. Fabric is a tool to run scripts on a 
remote server:

    apt-get install python python-pip git
    git clone git://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-setup.git
    cd cozy-setup
    sudo pip install fabric 
    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/frankrousseau/fabtools.git

Once your system is prepared, then use the Fabric script from your local
machine to launch the cozy installation:

    fab -H user@ip:port install

Fill what you want when installer will ask you for informations about the
certificate. 

Be patient some commands or app deployements could take a few minutes. It 
depends about your network and your hardware capabilities.

*Vagrant*

If you want to use vagrant to run Cozy Cloud Setup in a virtual machine
we recommend you the Ubuntu 12.04 box. Be careful update will require that
you configure your boot sequence. Chose the first filesystem they will propose
you, then click ok.

main account.

You can launch automatic test too (see README file located in test directory).
